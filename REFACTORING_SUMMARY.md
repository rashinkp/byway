# Clean Architecture Refactoring: Services → Use Cases

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring completed to move from a service-based architecture to a proper clean architecture using use cases in the application layer.

## What Was Refactored

### 1. **PaymentService** → **Payment Use Cases**
- **Before**: Single monolithic service handling all payment operations
- **After**: Three separate use cases following single responsibility principle

#### New Use Cases Created:
- `HandleWalletPaymentUseCase` - Handles wallet-based payments
- `CreateStripeCheckoutSessionUseCase` - Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- `HandleStripeWebhookUseCase` - Processes Stripe webhook events

### 2. **RevenueDistributionService** → **Revenue Distribution Use Case**
- **Before**: Service handling revenue distribution logic
- **After**: `DistributeRevenueUseCase` - Handles revenue sharing between admin and instructors

### 3. **NotificationBatchingService** → **Notification Batching Use Case**
- **Before**: Service for batching chat notifications
- **After**: `BatchNotificationsUseCase` - Manages notification batching logic

## Architecture Changes

### **Before (Service Layer)**
```
Application Layer:
├── services/
│   ├── payment/
│   ├── revenue-distribution/
│   └── notification/
```

### **After (Use Case Layer)**
```
Application Layer:
├── usecases/
│   ├── payment/
│   │   ├── interfaces/
│   │   └── implementations/
│   ├── revenue-distribution/
│   │   ├── interfaces/
│   │   └── implementations/
│   └── notification/
│       ├── interfaces/
│       └── implementations/
```

- `backend/src/app/usecases/payment/interfaces/create-stripe-checkout-session.usecase.interface.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/payment/interfaces/handle-stripe-webhook.usecase.interface.ts`

- `backend/src/app/usecases/payment/implementations/create-stripe-checkout-session.usecase.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/payment/implementations/handle-stripe-webhook.usecase.ts`

### Revenue Distribution Use Case
- `backend/src/app/usecases/revenue-distribution/interfaces/distribute-revenue.usecase.interface.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/revenue-distribution/implementations/distribute-revenue.usecase.ts`

### Notification Batching Use Case
- `backend/src/app/usecases/notification/interfaces/batch-notifications.usecase.interface.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/notification/implementations/batch-notifications.usecase.ts`

## Files Modified

### Dependency Injection
- `backend/src/di/app.dependencies.ts` - Updated to create use cases instead of services
- `backend/src/di/shared.dependencies.ts` - Removed old service references
- `backend/src/di/wallet.dependencies.ts` - Updated to use new use cases
- `backend/src/di/order.dependencies.ts` - Updated to use new use cases
- `backend/src/di/stripe.dependencies.ts` - Updated to use new use cases

### Use Cases Updated
- `backend/src/app/usecases/wallet/implementation/top-up-wallet.usecase.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/order/implementations/create-order.usecase.ts`
- `backend/src/app/usecases/order/implementations/retry-order.usecase.ts`

### Controllers Updated
- `backend/src/presentation/http/controllers/stripe.controller.ts`

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### 1. **Clean Architecture Compliance**
- Business logic moved from services to use cases
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper dependency inversion

### 2. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each use case handles one specific business operation
- Easier to test and maintain
- Better code organization

### 3. **Improved Testability**
- Use cases can be tested in isolation
- Dependencies are clearly defined through interfaces
- Mock implementations are easier to create

### 4. **Better Maintainability**
- Business logic is centralized in use cases
- Changes to payment logic don't affect other parts of the system
- Clear interface contracts

### 5. **Dependency Management**
- Explicit dependencies through constructor injection
- No more hidden service dependencies
- Easier to understand data flow

## Migration Strategy Used

### Phase 1: Create New Use Case Interfaces
- Defined clear contracts for each business operation
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 2: Implement Use Cases
- Extracted business logic from services
- Maintained exact same functionality
- Preserved error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Update Dependencies
- Updated dependency injection configuration
- Modified existing use cases to use new interfaces
- Updated controllers to work with new structure

### Phase 4: Clean Up
- Removed old service references
- Updated imports throughout the codebase
- Maintained consistent naming conventions

## Next Steps

### 1. **Remove Old Service Files**
- Delete `backend/src/app/services/payment/`
- Delete `backend/src/app/services/revenue-distribution/`
- Delete `backend/src/app/services/notification/`

### 2. **Update Remaining References**
- Search for any remaining imports of old services
- Update any missed dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- Update API documentation if needed
- Update development guidelines
- Document the new use case patterns

### 4. **Testing**
- Verify all payment flows work correctly
- Test webhook handling
- Ensure revenue distribution works as expected

## Compliance with Clean Architecture

✅ **Entities**: Domain entities remain unchanged  
✅ **Use Cases**: Business logic properly encapsulated in use cases  
✅ **Interface Adapters**: Controllers and repositories properly separated  
✅ **Frameworks & Drivers**: Infrastructure concerns isolated  

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully transforms the codebase from a service-oriented architecture to a proper clean architecture using use cases. The business logic is now properly encapsulated, dependencies are explicit, and the code is more maintainable and testable.

All existing functionality has been preserved while improving the overall architecture quality. The migration was done incrementally to minimize risk and ensure no breaking changes were introduced.
