# Domain Layer Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to the domain layer to follow clean architecture principles. The goal was to remove persistence concerns, DTOs, and mapping logic, keeping only core business logic and domain rules.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Persistence Concerns

**Before:**
- Static factory methods like `fromPrisma()`, `create()`, `update()`
- DTO interfaces for creation and updates
- Mapping logic between persistence and domain models
- UUID generation in domain entities

**After:**
- Simple constructors with validation
- No persistence-specific code
- Pure domain logic only

### 2. Removed DTOs and Interfaces

**Before:**
```typescript
interface ICreateUserRequestDTO {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password?: string;
  // ...
}

static create(dto: ICreateUserRequestDTO): User {
  // Factory method with DTO
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
constructor(props: {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: Email;
  // ...
}) {
  this.validateUser(props);
  // Direct assignment
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Domain Validation

**Before:**
- Validation scattered across factory methods
- Inconsistent validation rules

**After:**
- Centralized validation in private methods
- Consistent validation rules
- Clear error messages

### 4. Improved Business Logic Methods

**Before:**
- Limited business logic
- Some methods returning new instances instead of modifying state

**After:**
- Rich business logic methods
- State modification with proper validation
- Clear domain rules and invariants

## Entities Refactored

### 1. User Entity

**Changes:**
- Removed `ICreateUserRequestDTO`, `IUpdateUserRequestDTO`, `UserInterface`
- Removed static factory methods `create()`, `update()`, `fromPrisma()`
- Added `validateUser()` method for centralized validation
- Enhanced business logic methods:
  - `updateProfile()`
  - `changeRole()`
  - `canAccessInstructorFeatures()`
  - `canAccessAdminFeatures()`
  - `hasValidAuthentication()`

**Business Rules:**
- Name is required and cannot be empty
- At least one authentication method required
- Auth provider must match provided credentials
- Email verification and deletion state management

### 2. Course Entity

**Changes:**
- Removed `CourseProps` interface and static factory methods
- Removed `toJSON()` and `fromPrisma()` methods
- Added `validateCourse()` method
- Enhanced business logic methods:
  - `updateRating()`
  - `updateLessonCount()`
  - `setBestSeller()`
  - `isPublished()`
  - `canBeEnrolled()`
  - `getFinalPrice()`
  - `isFree()`

**Business Rules:**
- Title is required
- Category ID and creator ID are required
- Admin share percentage must be between 0-100
- Rating must be between 0-5
- Lesson count cannot be negative

### 3. Category Entity

**Changes:**
- Removed `CategoryProps` interface and static factory methods
- Removed `fromPersistence()` method
- Added `validateCategory()` method
- Enhanced business logic methods:
  - `update()` with validation
  - `hasDescription()`

**Business Rules:**
- Category ID, name, and creator ID are required
- Description cannot exceed 500 characters
- Name cannot exceed 100 characters

### 4. Lesson Entity

**Changes:**
- Removed `LessonProps` interface and static factory methods
- Removed `toJSON()` and `fromPersistence()` methods
- Added `validateLesson()` method
- Enhanced business logic methods:
  - `setContent()` and `removeContent()`
  - `isPublished()`
  - `hasContent()`
  - `canBeAccessed()`

**Business Rules:**
- Lesson ID, course ID, title, order, and status are required
- Content management with proper state updates

### 5. Instructor Entity

**Changes:**
- Removed `InstructorInterface` and static factory methods
- Removed `fromPrisma()` method
- Added `validateInstructor()` method with URL validation
- Enhanced business logic methods:
  - `updateProfile()` with validation
  - `incrementStudentCount()` and `decrementStudentCount()`
  - `isApproved()`, `isPending()`, `isDeclined()`
  - `canCreateCourses()`
  - `hasCompleteProfile()`

**Business Rules:**
- All required fields must be provided
- Website URL must be valid
- Total students cannot be negative
- Status transitions with proper validation

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Clean Architecture Compliance
- Domain layer is now independent of infrastructure concerns
- No dependencies on external frameworks or libraries
- Pure business logic without persistence knowledge

### 2. Better Testability
- Entities can be tested in isolation
- No need to mock persistence layer for domain logic tests
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability
- Business rules are centralized and clearly defined
- Changes to persistence layer don't affect domain logic
- Easier to understand and modify business rules

### 4. Improved Domain Modeling
- Rich domain objects with behavior
- Clear invariants and business rules
- Better encapsulation of domain knowledge

## Next Steps

### 1. Repository Pattern Implementation
- Create repository interfaces in domain layer
- Implement repositories in infrastructure layer
- Use dependency injection for repository access

### 2. Domain Services
- Extract complex business logic that doesn't belong to a single entity
- Create domain services for cross-entity operations

### 3. Value Objects
- Continue using existing value objects (Email, Price, Duration, etc.)
- Create additional value objects for complex domain concepts

### 4. Domain Events
- Consider implementing domain events for important state changes
- Use events for cross-boundary communication

## Migration Guide

### For Application Layer
- Update use cases to work with new entity constructors
- Remove DTO-to-entity mapping logic
- Use repository pattern for entity creation and updates

### For Infrastructure Layer
- Implement repository interfaces
- Handle entity-to-persistence mapping
- Manage ID generation and timestamps

### For Tests
- Update unit tests to use new constructors
- Remove persistence-related test setup
- Focus on testing business logic and domain rules

## Conclusion

The refactored domain layer now follows clean architecture principles with:
- Pure business logic without persistence concerns
- Clear domain rules and validation
- Rich domain objects with behavior
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability and maintainability

This foundation provides a solid base for building a robust and maintainable application architecture.
